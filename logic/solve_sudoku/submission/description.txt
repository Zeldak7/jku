Each field in the sudoku is assigned an index starting at 1 and continuing from 
left to right and top to button to 16. Each field is associated with 4 variables 
which control its value. Variables are named "field_value"; the variable "1_2" 
corresponds to "field at index 1 has value 2", "5_4" corresponds to "field at 
index 5 has value 4". There are a total of 64 (16 * 4) variables.

There are basically two constraints:

- Each field needs to have exactly one value. (Ergo of the variables "n_1", "n_2",
  "n_3" and "n_4", where "n" is a field index, only one may be true.)
- Connected fields must have different values. Two fields are connected if they 
  are in the same row, column or square.

As such the problem is essentially analogous to graph coloring. The provided 
example steps to encode a graph coloring problem was used as a reference to 
implement the script which generated the encoding for this problem.

Sudoku51 as solved by the encoding:
2 3 4 1
4 1 2 3
1 2 3 4
3 4 1 2
