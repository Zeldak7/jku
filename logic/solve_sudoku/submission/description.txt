Lab Exercise 1: Sudoku
Laurenz Weixlbaumer, 11804751

Each field in the sudoku is associated with 4 variables which control its value.
The variables are named "field_value"; the variable "1_2" corresponds to "field 
at index 1 has value 2". Therefore there are 16 such variables.

There are basically two constraints:

- Each field needs to have exactly one value. (Ergo of the variables "n_1", "n_2",
  "n_3" and "n_4", where "n" is a field index, only one may be true.)
- Connected fields must have different values. Two fields are connected if they 
  are in the same row, column or square.

As such it is essentially analogous to graph coloring.
