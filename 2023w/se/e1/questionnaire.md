__Q1__ The primary goal of Dronology appears to be creating a research environment for studying software/systems engineering, with a particular focus on safety. This is made possible by the secondary goal, to engineer a framework for controlling and coordinating multiple UAVs in a safe manner, with runtime monitoring and onboard intelligence.

__Q2__ The four layers are Ground Control Station, CORE, Services and UI. Any two adjacent layers (in the given ordering) communicate with each other. Communication with the UAVs happens through GCS.

__Q3__ Depending on use case: emergency responders, FAA regulators, environmentalists, farmers, the general public

__Q4__ Overview of components, several use-case descriptions with supporting use cases, list of requirements, architecture overview
